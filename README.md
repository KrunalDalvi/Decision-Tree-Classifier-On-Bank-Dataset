# Decision-Tree-Classifier-On-Bank-Dataset
Predicting customer purchase behavior is crucial for effective marketing strategies. This project aims to create a decision tree classifier to forecast whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data. Utilizing the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which includes features such as age, job, marital status, education, balance, housing loan status, and previous campaign outcomes, we will develop a model to enhance marketing efforts and target potential customers more accurately.
